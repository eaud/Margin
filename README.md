# Margin
(currently deployed at [margn.herokuapp.com](margin.herokuapp.com))

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This repo contains the Ember.js frontend, which pairs with a Rails-API, [found here](https://github.com/kaylee42/margin-api).


## About

Margin is a project by [@kaylee42](https://github.com/kaylee42), [@jappleba](https://github.com/jappleba), and [@eaud](https://github.com/eaud) while at Flatiron School.  Margin is intended to be a utility app for programmers taking notes about code.
